The Corner Grocer program enables the user to parse data files and return frequency counts on different data items as well as displaying a histogram. In particular for aiding in tracking sales for items in a grocery store.
I was able to confidently handle error input validation via various if statements.
Further enhancements to the code can be made. A proper GUI would help make the program more modern and accessible. Further menu options can be implemented such as an option to store data in daily, weekly, quartly, and yearly databases for comparassion.
A challenging part of creating this program was implementing case sensitvity error handling. The sample data from the file included data names that were all capitalized. I knew a common issue when reading user input in reference to data names was the mismatch of case. I created the ToLower function to convert data read from the file as well as user input into lower case.
Creating this program helped me get comfortable with anticipating errors. It's important to try put yourself in the user's shoes and view your program how they would. What common mistakes could throw an error? How might this be confusing to someone who didn't create the program?
One of the most important best practices to follow is to add plenty of comments into your code. I did so in this program with a healthy amount of in line and header comments explaining functions, and other parts of the program.
